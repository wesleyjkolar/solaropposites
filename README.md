# SolarOpposites
Solar Opposites is a game I made with pygame as a personal project. Based on the classic game Space Invaders- the players objective is to shoot down the enemies floating in space, before they shoot the player. The player can take 3 hits before their 'life' is depleted, and they lose. I themed the game after the Hulu Original Tv Show "Solar Opposites".
